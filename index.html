  <h1>Lead Poisoning</h1>
  <div id="introduction">
    <h2>The History of Lead Poisoning</h2>
    <p>During the Ancient Roman Empire, pipes were built with lead because of the metal’s relative affordability and abundance. It was also found in cosmetics, paints, wines, pottery, and coins.</p>
    <h2>Inorganic lead and lead salts(Pb2+, PbCl2, Pb(NO3)2)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Ingested via contaminated water/paint or inhaled from contaminated dust.</li>
      <li>Lead’s half life varies: in blood, it is about one month; in soft tissue, it is about 1-1.5 months; in bone, it is about 25-30 years. Therefore, limited but persistent exposure during childhood can pose a serious health risk.</li> 
      <li>Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, seizures, memory loss, and in pregnant women, miscarriages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Inhibition of heme biosynthesis</h2>
    <p>Lead inhibits the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), which is an important catalyst in a step of the heme biosynthesis pathway. Lead’s atomic structure plays a role in displacing the zinc cation which is essential to ALAD activity.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of the periodic table, lead is an especially heavy metal (at 207.2 g/mol), and has four valence electrons. However, lead tends to have an oxidation state of 2+ rather than 4+ due to the inert pair effect. This is why: As the atomic number increases, the velocity of the core electrons increase → higher relativistic mass according to the Theory of Relativity → electrons are closer to the nucleus. This affects the s orbital more than the p orbital (the s orbital is closer to the d orbital of the previous energy level than the p orbital). Either way, the ionization energy of the s electrons increases.</p>
    <p>So the 6s electrons are left as a lone pair, or an inert pair. This inert pair can get in the way when lead bonds to other atoms. Lead displaces zinc when it encounters the ALAD enzyme, but because enzymes are very specific, lead’s extra exercise electrons totally inhibit the enzyme’s activity. As a result, ed blood cell formation is disrupted, and the victim can develop severe anemia.</p>
    <h2>Role in the brain </h2>
    <p>In the brain, calcium stimulates the release of neurotransmitters, which carry the activation signal from neuron to neuron. Lead imitates the role of calcium:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Presence of lead → less calcium in the neuron → less neurotransmitters → weaker/incorrect signal to the next neuron</li>
    </ul>

    <div id="science of organic lead">
      <h2>Tetraethyl lead (organic)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nonpolar and highly lipophilic nature → soluble in nonpolar substances, and tends to readily accumulate in the brain.</li>
        <li>Metabolized to a salt of triethyl lead (the most neurotoxic part), and inorganic lead, which is stored in the bones.</li>
        <li>In rats and dogs, triethyl lead is thought to be toxic because it acts as a catalyst for the transformation of norepinephrine into an aminochrome. When this is combined with other effects (namely issues involving acetylcholine), it forms a psychotogenic complex that may cause psychotic disturbances. </li>
      </ul>

    <div id="real world relevance">
    <h2>Real-world relevance: Flint, Michigan</h2>
    <p>Pipes were made out of lead, and more acidic water was taken from Flint River instead of Lake Huron. Because of the water’s acidity, the protective coating of lead phosphate on the pipes wore away and the lead was able to easily leach into the water.</p>
    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add orthophosphates</li>
      <li>Treat water so that it has a high pH (becomes more basic), which decreases the solubility of lead carbonates (these also make up the pipe’s protective mineral layer)</li>
    </ul>
